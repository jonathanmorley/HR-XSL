       CancelApplicationForm conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated ApplicationForm instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       ApplicationForm  Contains a set of information about assessment services or tests available to a customer. Enables the discovery of &quot;Package IDs&quot; which are necessary to place an order using HR-XML's assessment order specification. A &quot;Package&quot; may consist of one or more assessment instruments. An &quot;assessment package&quot; is the marketable unit of assessment or testing services that may be ordered. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the ApplicationForm noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
